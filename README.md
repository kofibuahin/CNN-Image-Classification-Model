# CNN-Image-Classification-Model

As a part of my self-directed learning on Neural Networks and Deep learning, I decided to use the Natural Images Dataset that I sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasunroy/natural-images). This dataset is created as a benchmark dataset for the work on Effects of Degradations on Deep Neural Network Architectures (https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10108). The source code is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/prasunroy/cnn-on-degraded-images).

In this script I build and train 3 different types of Networks (2 Convolutional Neural Networks and 1 Multi-Layer Perceptron) on the Natural Images dataset and test their efficacy. At the end of the project, we conclude with a short fun activity where I apply the trained models to a 25-image dataset made up of images of my friends, some of their pets, famous cats & dogs and famous individuals in society.

Data Description:

The original dataset contains 6,899 images from 8 distinct classes compiled from various sources (see Acknowledgements). The original classes include airplane, car, cat, dog, flower, fruit, motorbike and person. Due to limitations on my computing power, I decided to limit the dataset to only the images that fell under the class dog, person & cat.

There are some additional acknowledgements for the source of the images from each class presented below:
